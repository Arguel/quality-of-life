# Udemy semi auto enroll free courses

A simple script that tries to save you a few clicks, the only problem it has is that you cannot select a specific country as the default

If the course you want to subscribe to is free, the script will go to the payment page directly, if you already have the course or if you have already subscribed correctly, it will auto close the browser tab

You can also configure the different parameters, the variables that modify the entire file are at the beginning of the code

The script is made to work with the English language, it is possible that if you use another language you will have to change the text of the variables

To use this script you only need an administrator/extension that allows you to use it automatically without having to type the code over and over again, I personally use Tampermonkey (you can use any other, just copy and paste the code) , it can be downloaded on its [official website](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or if you use Google Chrome you can [download the extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
